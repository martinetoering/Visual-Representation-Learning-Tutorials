    "The easiest way to load image data is with `datasets.ImageFolder` from `torchvision` ([documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder)). In general you'll use `ImageFolder` like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/data', transform=transform)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `'path/to/data'` is the file path to the data directory and `transform` is a list of processing steps built with the [`transforms`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html) module from `torchvision`. ImageFolder expects the files and directories to be constructed like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "root/dog/xxx.png\n",
    "root/dog/xxy.png\n",
    "root/dog/xxz.png\n",
    "\n",

So here, the image `123.png` would be loaded with the class label `cat`. You can download the dataset already structured like this [from here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/Cat_Dog_data.zip). I've also split it into a training set and test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load in the data with `ImageFolder`, you'll need to define some transforms. For example, the images are different sizes but we'll need them to all be the same size for training. You can either resize them with `transforms.Resize()` or crop with `transforms.CenterCrop()`, `transforms.RandomResizedCrop()`, etc. We'll also need to convert the images to PyTorch tensors with `transforms.ToTensor()`. Typically you'll combine these transforms into a pipeline with `transforms.Compose()`, which accepts a list of transforms and runs them in sequence. It looks something like this to scale, then crop, then convert to a tensor:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Loaders\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `ImageFolder` loaded, you have to pass it to a [`DataLoader`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader). The `DataLoader` takes a dataset (such as you would get from `ImageFolder`) and returns batches of images and the corresponding labels. You can set various parameters like the batch size and if the data is shuffled after each epoch.\n",

    "\n",
    "A common strategy for training neural networks is to introduce randomness in the input data itself. For example, you can randomly rotate, mirror, scale, and/or crop your images during training. This will help your network generalize as it's seeing the same images but in different locations, with different sizes, in different orientations, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can find a list of all [the available transforms here](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.0/torchvision/transforms.html). When you're testing however, you'll want to use images that aren't altered (except you'll need to normalize the same way). So, for validation/test images, you'll typically just resize and crop.\n",
