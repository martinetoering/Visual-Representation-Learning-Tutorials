    "A self-supervised learning approach we want to find ways of letting a model generate its own labels automatically. ‘Pretext tasks’ are designed so that a model performs a prediction task on the data itself. An example can be found in augmenting an image and train a network to learn what kind of augmentation has been applied. In this way, both the original image and the target are provided. "
