    "# Introduction to Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are a type of neural network that tries to learn parameters that make the output as close to the input as possible. One simple way to do this is by returning the input directly. However, autoencoders can add a hidden layer which has a encoding of the data. This encoding is a compression, and the process of reconstructing the input from this encoding is called decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 1: A Simple Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start off by building a simple autoencoder to compress the MNIST dataset. With autoencoders, we pass input data through an encoder that makes a compressed representation of the input. Then, this representation is passed through a decoder to reconstruct the input data. Generally the encoder and decoder will be built with neural networks, then trained on example data.\n",
